      "I am an engineering post-graduate with a deep passion for technology and software development, committed to building high-impact, scalable solutions. My career has focused on optimizing engineering productivity, ensuring system reliability, and streamlining release engineering processes. While leading a talented team to enhance Jio’s Ecommerce ecosystem—including JioMart, TIRA, JioMart Partners, Fynd Retail Platform, JioMarket, and JioMart Digital—I encountered challenges in maintaining efficiency, scalability, and automation in modern software development. These experiences inspired me to co-found ratl.ai, an AI-powered platform that automates and optimizes post-development processes.This platform aims to revolutionize software quality, boost developer productivity, and redefine how engineering teams tackle testing at scale",

      "I specialize in scaling high-performance applications, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and engineering fault-tolerant, self-healing systems. With expertise in containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), microservices orchestration, chaos engineering, and cloud observability, I thrive on solving mission-critical bottlenecks and fine-tuning system latencies to drive engineering efficiency at scale. My technical stack spans full-stack development, distributed systems, and intelligent automation, leveraging technologies like Next.js, React.js, Node.js, Python, Go, FastAPI, and Express.js, backed by MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis. I have deep experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Tekton), infrastructure as code (Terraform, Pulumi), and API design with GraphQL and REST. Additionally, I integrate AI-driven automation with frameworks like LangChain and OpenAI APIs, along with performance testing using Gatling, JMeter, and Locust. My focus remains on building resilient, scalable, and AI-augmented engineering solutions that ensure seamless development, deployment, and system reliability.",
